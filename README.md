# stock-graph-generator
A interface the generates graphs of stocks or cryptos in a choosen timeline
I've used matplotlib, pandas and pandas_datareader to get stocks and crypto information, and Tkinter to make the UI.
You choose the type of stock or crypto, the ticker, teh start and teh end date you want to plot the graph.
